# -Network-Lab-Optimized-VLAN-Design-with-SVI-DHCP-Server-and-VTP-Core
This lab demonstrates a scalable and efficient Layer 2/3 network design that reduces router load and improves performance. It uses:  SVIs for inter-VLAN routing on the Core Switch. A dedicated DHCP server in VLAN 40 to assign IP addresses. VTP to distribute VLAN configurations from the Core Switch to access switches.
